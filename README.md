# Benchmarking-DL-Fuzzers
There are multiple API-level fuzzing of Deep Learning libraries proposed in the literature. But, there is a gap here to check the effectiveness of fuzzers on detecting real-world bugs/security vulnerabilities. In this project, we extensively compare DL fuzzers to understand their effectiveness on know real-world bugs.
